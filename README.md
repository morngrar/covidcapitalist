# COVID Capitalist
48h jam based on Weekly Game Jam week 163, from a team of three. The theme: **Tycoon**

## Installing
The game has two dependencies. Python 3 and the module `pygame`.

### Windows
Get the latest version of python [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.9/python-3.7.9-amd64.exe)

After installing, run the following command in a console:

        py -m pip install -U pygame --user

### Linux
Python should already be installed on your system, but if not, install python 3, and make sure the version is at least 3.7.

Install pygame through your package manager with `sudo dnf install python3-pygame` or equivalent.

## Running the game
### Windows
Clone the repo and run the `main.py` file, either by double-clicking or running it in console:

        py main.py

### Linux
Clone the repo and run `main-py` from that directory.

If your distro is modern, python 3 should be your default python instance, and `python main.py` should work.

If not, do `python3 main.py`
